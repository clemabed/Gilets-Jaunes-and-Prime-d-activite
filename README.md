# Gilets Jaunes and Prime d'activité

This Master’s thesis presents the impact of the revaluation of the Prime d’activité, following the measures taken by Emmanuel Macron in December 2018, on the Gilets Jaunes mobilization. It examines the relationship between the average impact of the reform at the local level (measured by microsimulation) and the Gilets Jaunes mobilization, both offline – physical protests and online – discussions in Facebook groups about this measure.

This project is divided in several codes files depending on the language used : 
- Stata
- Python

Codes must be launched by chronological order.
Data on Prime d'activité was made available by the CAF and data on Gilet Jaunes by Boyer et al. (2020).
